# Scrawlers

Scrawlers was my first Rails app, my learning playground and a place for tons of mistakes. [Nathan Melcher](http://www.nathanmelcher.com/) and I cooked it up and really enjoyed it for several years. We wrote many 100-word stories and commented on a bunch more. For a while there were new stories nearly every day. When it was hit by spam late this summer, after many relatively dormant months, it became time to end it. Thanks for all the stories, Scrawlers.

### The Final State

I believe Scrawlers finished at Rails 2.2.2 (or so). I had 75 items in my to-do list at the time of closure, many of those simply cleaning up the trash code that was there from the beginning. The code is not pleasant. I don't want to look at it again, not sure why you would.
