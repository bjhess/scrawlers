If you are using Rails and want some basic generic tests, you can run the
following code inside test_helper.rb:

  require 'scaffolding_extensions/rails_test_help'

This gives you the following test class methods:

  test_scaffold_all_models
  test_scaffold

And the following test instance methods:

  scaffold_test
  scaffold_habtm_test

There is an automated test suite that tests the plugin against all supported web
frameworks and ORMs. It is now available in the same github repository as the
plugin itself.

It requires the ruby-sytle, hpricot, and mongrel gems (in addition to gems for
all of the frameworks and ORMs), and does black box testing of the plugin by
running a web crawler against a running application that uses the plugin.
