To use this plugin after installing the gem:

  require 'scaffolding_extensions'

If you want to use it without installing the gem, add this before requiring
it:

  $:.unshift('scaffolding_extensions/lib')

If your models are not located in model/, it is easiest to let Scaffolding
Extensions know about them manually (this is only necessary if you are using
scaffold_all_models without :only):

  ScaffoldingExtensions.all_models = [Model1, Model2, Model3]

You should add this code after your models have been loaded but before your
controllers have been loaded.

Also, note that Scaffolding Extensions uses the :Erubis engine in Ramaze,
so you must have Erubis installed to use it.
