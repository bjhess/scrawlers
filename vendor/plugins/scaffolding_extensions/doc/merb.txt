To use this plugin after installing the gem, somewhere in your Merb config,
add:

  require 'scaffolding_extensions'
 
Then you can use scaffold, scaffold_habtm, or scaffold_all_models in your
controllers:

  class Admin < Merb::Controller
    scaffold Model1
    scaffold_habtm Model1, :things
    scaffold_all_models :only=>[Model1, Model2, Model3]
  end

Merb isn't fully supported in that if you override a scaffolded form
but don't add your own layout, it won't use the scaffolded layout. Also,
using your own layout and overriding the scaffolded forms is untested,
though it should work.
