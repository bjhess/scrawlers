This allows you to skip the output of the style when using scaffold auto
completing.  This is necessary if you want to be XHTML compliant, as style tags
aren't allowed inside form elements.

To use this, add the .css file to your layout. Then set this in your
application's environment:

  ScaffoldingExtensions.auto_complete_skip_style = true
