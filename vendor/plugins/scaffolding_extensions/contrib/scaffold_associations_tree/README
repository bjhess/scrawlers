This allows you to change the scaffolded display of associated items in the
edit view from a simple list to a explorer-style clickable tree.

To use this, include the .gifs in the /images subdirectory (or modify the .css
file), and add the .css and .js files to the layout.

Then set this in your application's environment:

  ActiveRecord::Base::SCAFFOLD_OPTIONS[:association_list_class] = 'scaffold_associations_tree'
