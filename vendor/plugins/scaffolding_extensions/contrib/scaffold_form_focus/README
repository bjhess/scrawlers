This allows you to auto focus the page to the first form field.

To use this, conditionally include the .js file in your layout via something
like:

  <%= javascript_include_tag('scaffold_form_focus') if @scaffold_options %>

The if statement makes it take effect for the scaffolded pages (which always
define @scaffold_options).  Note that the code is fairly simplistic, it just
focuses on the first text input, password input, textarea, or
select box on the page, so if your layout has a form before the scaffolded
form, you'll probably want to modify the code.
